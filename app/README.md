TodoMVC sample application written with the
[Polymer.dart package][polymer-dart], which includes
custom elements and data binding.

To run this code with Dartium, launch `web/index.html`.

To run this code with Chrome/Firefox/etc, run `build.dart` first,
and then right-click on `out/web/index.html` and select 'Run as JavaScript'.

Generated code will be created under "out/web/". Any time you edit and save a 
source file, the necessary files will be regenerated automatically. Look at
`build.dart` to see how this works.
